  "description": "This repository contains data, analysis scripts, and figures used in the study of amphipathic helix (AH) domains in septin assembly. Using all-atom molecular dynamics simulations, the work explores how single and multiple AH peptides interact with lipid bilayers, including membrane-induced curvature, peptide bending, lipid packing defects, and peptide-peptide interactions. The findings contribute to understanding cooperative membrane binding and septin filament formation.",
