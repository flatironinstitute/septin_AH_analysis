## Data and Materials

This repository contains:
- Processed output from molecular dynamics simulations (e.g., local bending angles, area-per-lipid maps, nematic order parameters)
- Python analysis scripts used to generate all reported metrics and visualizations
- Figure panels and snapshot frames from simulation trajectories
- Sequence alignments and tools for generating conservation figures

> üîó *Note: Due to size constraints, raw simulation trajectories are not included here but are available upon request.*

## Manifest

- `scripts/` ‚Äì All Python scripts and Jupyter notebooks used to analyze simulation data, including calculations of bending angles, area-per-lipid (APL) maps, nematic order parameters, and salt bridge interactions.
- `data/` ‚Äì Processed data files generated from VMD's SaltBridge Tool and Bendix, used in figures and plots.
- `figures/` ‚Äì Final figure panels and individual visualizations included in the manuscript.
- `movies/` ‚Äì Compressed simulation videos demonstrating single and paired peptide conformations and membrane interactions.
