## Data and Materials

This repository contains:
- Processed output from molecular dynamics simulations (e.g., local bending angles, area-per-lipid maps, nematic order parameters)
- Python analysis scripts used to generate all reported metrics and visualizations
- Figure panels and snapshot frames from simulation trajectories
- Sequence alignments and tools for generating conservation figures

> üîó *Note: Due to size constraints, raw simulation trajectories are not included here but are available upon request.*
